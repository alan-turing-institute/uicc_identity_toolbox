# Shadytel SIM Tools

This is a version of the Shadytel Shadysim tools modified and enhanced
for the use with the
[sysmoUSIM-SJA2 sim cards](https://osmocom.org/projects/cellular-infrastructure/wiki/SysmoISIM-SJA2)

Contrary to the cards used by the original Shadtyel tools, the
sysmoUSIM-SJA2 have OTA security enabled and require the use of KIC/KID
to authenticate + encrypt the PDUs of the Remote Application Management
(RAM).

This version is also modified to permit the use of the UICC tooklit and 
UICC access packages described in ETSI TS 102 241.

## Creating JavaCard STK Applets

Use the hello-stk example to get started.

	$ mkdir javacard
	$ cd javacard
	$ git clone https://git.osmocom.org/sim/sim-tools
	$ git clone https://git.osmocom.org/sim/hello-stk
	$ cd hello-stk
	$ make

To install the applet onto a SIM card, first set the type of reader you are using.

	# For PCSC readers:
    $ export SHADYSIM_OPTIONS="--pcsc"

	# For USB-serial readers:
    $ export SHADYSIM_OPTIONS="--serialport /dev/ttyUSB0"

and follow instructions at <https://osmocom.org/projects/cellular-infrastructure/wiki/Shadysimpy>

The shadysim tool has lots of other options.

    $ ./sim-tools/bin/shadysim --help
